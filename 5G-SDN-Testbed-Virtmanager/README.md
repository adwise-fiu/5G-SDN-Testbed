## Acknowledgments ##

This version of 5G-SDN testbed demo was possible by merging open-source projects: 

- [OpenvSwitch](https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs "OpenvSwitch")

- [Open5Gs](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs "Open5Gs")

- [UERANSIM](https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM "UERANSIM")




# Design Open-Source SDN-based 5G Standalone Testbed using Virt-Manager #

## Project Description ##
This project focuses on implementing Standalone (SA) mode in 5G Networks using SDN and NFV. We have utilized various open-source projects, including Open5Gs, UERANSIM, and OpenvSwitch (OVS), to build and deploy our testbed. We wil provide a comprehensive instructions to replicate our deployed testbed. 

## Getting started ##
This project consists of several steps based on building several projects to deploy a 5G-SDN testbed, which are the following: 

1. Setup SDN environment
2. Deploy and Configure Open5Gs
3. Deploy and Configure UERANSIM 


When it comes to the the Open5GS installation, there are two available options:

* Install from [source project](https://github.com/adwise-fiu/5G-SDN-Testbed/tree/main/5G-SDN-Testbed-Virtmanager/source)
* Install from [package manager](https://github.com/adwise-fiu/5G-SDN-Testbed/tree/main/5G-SDN-Testbed-Virtmanager/package-manager)
